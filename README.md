# Event-Driven Prediction: Expanding Mamba State Space Models for Conditional Forecasting
A Novel Approach Combining Markov Decision Theory and Neural State Space Models for Stock Price Prediction
Let's say you're trying to predict stock prices, but you don't just want to know if the price will go up or down tomorrow. Instead, you're asking a smarter question: What will happen if tomorrow's price crosses a certain threshold? For example, if a stock price drops below a key support level tomorrow, what's likely to happen in the days that follow? This kind of conditional forecasting isn't just more insightful, it's closer to real decisions made in financial markets.
Here's the catch: traditional time series models aren't designed for this "what if" scenario. This is where we apply Markov Decision Theory and combine it with neural state space models like Mamba to build something new. 
Extending the classic state space framework, we can incorporate future conditions - like "tomorrow's price event" - directly into the prediction process. Think of it like giving the model a crystal ball, not just to see what's happened in the past, but to condition its predictions on what might happen next.
In this paper, we'll dive into this new approach. We'll explore how adding event-driven dynamics to Mamba state space models opens up new possibilities for forecasting. We'll also show how these ideas connect to Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and why they're useful for complex, high-stakes predictions like stock price movements. Along the way, we'll use intuitive examples, easy-to-follow equations, and real-world data to demonstrate the potential of this method.
